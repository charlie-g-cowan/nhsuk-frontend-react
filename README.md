# react-styled-nhs

- React components based on the NHS frontend system (https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend)
- For more generalised React components, I advise using https://github.com/NHSDigital/nhsuk-react-components
- This project was built as part of a Uni project and very limited in scope, so that is why I did not use the more generalised module
